LEGO Turret
=====================

*Git Repository created by Kevin Nguyen.*

Capstone project created by **Kevin Nguyen** & **Nathan Lee**.

The contents in this repo contains past models and code used for this project.

---

This project utilizes  the Raspberry Pi microcontroller, LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0, and the BrickPi module for the Raspberry Pi. An external sensor was used for the "turret_sensor.py" and requires a PIR sensor to operate this code.

To setup the BrickPi module onto your Raspberry Pi, go to Dexter Industries's [repository] (https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi_Python "BrickPi Python" ) on the BrickPi and follow their instructions to make the BrickPi module global.
